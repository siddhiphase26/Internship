## Task-4
# Multi-Step Student Registration Form

## Project Overview

This project is a **5-Step Student Registration Form** designed using HTML and CSS. Instead of using one long form, the registration process is divided into multiple steps to make it **simple, user-friendly, and easy to understand**. Each step collects specific information and follows the same design theme for consistency.

The project is suitable for **college assignments, internships, and beginner-level web development practice**.
